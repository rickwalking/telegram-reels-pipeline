# Hashtag Strategy

## Tiered Structure

Generate 10-15 hashtags organized in three tiers for optimal reach:

### Tier 1: Broad Reach (3-5 hashtags)
Posts with 500K+ usage. These expose the Reel to large audiences.

**Always include**:
- `#podcast`
- `#podcastclips`
- `#reels`

**Additional broad tags** (pick 1-2 based on content):
- `#motivation`, `#inspiration`, `#knowledge`, `#deepconversation`
- `#mustwatch`, `#viral`, `#trending`

### Tier 2: Medium Reach (3-5 hashtags)
Posts with 50K-500K usage. These target interested communities.

**Category-based selection**:
- Tech/AI: `#techpodcast`, `#aipodcast`, `#artificialintelligence`, `#futuretech`
- Business: `#entrepreneurpodcast`, `#businessmindset`, `#startuplife`
- Science: `#sciencepodcast`, `#research`, `#discovery`
- Culture: `#culturepodcast`, `#society`, `#currentaffairs`
- Health: `#healthpodcast`, `#wellness`, `#mindset`

### Tier 3: Niche Tags (4-5 hashtags)
Posts with <50K usage. These reach highly engaged micro-communities.

**Derived from content**:
- Topic-specific: `#[specifictopic]` (e.g., `#alignmentresearch`, `#quantumcomputing`)
- Guest/show tags: `#[guestname]`, `#[showname]` (when identifiable from metadata)
- Episode-specific: `#[keyterm]` from the selected moment's key themes

## Hashtag Rules

1. **Every hashtag starts with #** — validate format
2. **No spaces in hashtags** — use camelCase or concatenation: `#AIethics` not `#AI ethics`
3. **10-15 total** — Instagram allows max 30, but 10-15 is optimal for reach
4. **No banned or spammy tags** — avoid `#followforfollow`, `#like4like`, `#instagood`
5. **Relevant to content** — every hashtag must relate to the episode topic, guest, or theme

## Selection Process

1. Start with the 3 mandatory broad tags
2. Add 2-3 medium tags matching the episode's primary category
3. Add 4-5 niche tags derived from `key_themes` and `topic_focus`
4. If guest/show names are identifiable, include as niche tags
5. Verify total is 10-15 and all start with #
