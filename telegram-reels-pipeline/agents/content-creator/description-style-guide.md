# Description Style Guide

## Format Structure

Each description follows a four-part format:

1. **Hook Line** (first sentence): Grabs attention immediately. Question, bold statement, or surprising fact.
2. **Context** (1-2 sentences): Sets the scene — who is speaking, what they're discussing.
3. **Key Insight** (1-2 sentences): The core value of the clip.
4. **Call-to-Action** (final sentence): Drives engagement.

## Three Tones

Each content package includes exactly 3 descriptions, each with a different tone:

### 1. Informative
- Objective, educational tone
- Focuses on the insight or knowledge shared
- Example hook: "Here's what most people get wrong about AI alignment..."
- CTA: "Follow for more insights from top thinkers."

### 2. Provocative
- Bold, opinion-forward tone
- Highlights controversy or counterintuitive points
- Example hook: "This might be the most controversial take on AI safety you'll hear this year."
- CTA: "Agree or disagree? Drop your take in the comments."

### 3. Inspirational
- Uplifting, motivational tone
- Emphasizes human stories, ambition, or vision
- Example hook: "Sometimes one conversation can change how you see everything."
- CTA: "Save this for when you need a reminder of what matters."

## Length Guidelines

- **Instagram maximum**: 2,200 characters
- **Ideal length**: 150-300 characters (best engagement)
- **If the moment is complex**: up to 500 characters is acceptable
- **Never exceed 2,200 characters** — truncation will break the post

## Emoji Usage

- Use **2-4 emojis** per description
- Place emojis to enhance meaning, not as decoration
- Common placements: start of hook, between sections, before CTA
- Appropriate emojis: topic-relevant (brain, microphone, lightbulb, fire) — not random

## Call-to-Action Patterns

Choose one CTA per description (vary across the three):

- "Follow for more" — growth-focused
- "Save this for later" — value-focused
- "Tag someone who needs to hear this" — virality-focused
- "What do you think? Comment below" — engagement-focused
- "Link in bio for the full episode" — traffic-focused

## Things to Avoid

- Generic descriptions that could apply to any podcast clip
- Clickbait that doesn't match the actual content
- All-caps text (except for emphasis of 1-2 words)
- More than 4 emojis per description
- Hashtags in the description body (put them in the separate hashtags field)
